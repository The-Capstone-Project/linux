----- General Setup -----
i. changed kernel compression to LZ4 (less compressed, faster booting)

ii. changed default hostname to "capstone"

iii. turned off POSIX message Queues (unnessacary overhead, pipes and sockets are enough for IPC)

iv. disabled uselib syscall (legacy)


----- Processor Type and Features -----
i. disabled support for non-PC x86 platforms

ii. disabled rerouting for broken boot IRQs.
    boot Interrupt Requests (IRQs) help the boot process to initialize devices. modern hardware rarely
	has any issues with boot IRQs

iii. disabled IOPERM and IOPL (Input Output Permissions Bitmap and I/O Privilege Level)
     This emulates direct hardware access for software that require it, however it is only needed for 
	 legacy software designed to directly access hardware.

iv. disabled 5-level page tables support
    no one has > 256TB worth of ram. (this is a desktop OS)

v. set mtrr (memory type range registers) cleanup regiters number to 1.
   mtrr cleanup helps prevent stale mtrr registers. 
   the number of spare registers is set to 1 here.


----- Networking -----
i. disabled amatuer radio support (we're not running any ham radio things)


----- Block Devices -----
i. number of loop devices precreated at init time set to 0
   modern systems create loop devices dynamically are they're not required on init.
